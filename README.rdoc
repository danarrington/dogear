== DogEar

DogEar is a simple application to keep track of your reading.  Tell it which page your on and it will let you know
how fast you're reading the book and when you should be done.  It also keeps track of the total number of books
and pages you've read.

If that sounds questionably useful, well, you're right.  This is a simple app I re-write each time I learn a new
language or framework, and this is the rails iteration.
